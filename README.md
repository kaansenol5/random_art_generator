# Random "art" generator

i have no idea how & why this works, i made this accidentally

# Compiling

you need to have SDL2 and clang
 ~~~
 cmake.
 make
 ~~~

# Usage
~~~
randomart width height pixelsize mode seizure_mode
~~~

mode is 0 or 1, empty pixels vs filled pixels
seizure_mode is 0 or 1, 1 is not recommended for your eyes
smaller pixel size = slower generation
